# MachineLearnig_Biscuitssucre
This project is coded using the R programming language.
This project is a Machine Learning case study of which the goal is to use infrared spectrometry measurements (an observation is a spectrum measured on
700 frequencies) to determine sugar content of a biscuit without the need for costly chemical analysis.
In the Project several models and techniques are developed in order to compare results and boost the performance of the models when doing predictions. The dataset used is a very commonly used dataset in machine learning.
